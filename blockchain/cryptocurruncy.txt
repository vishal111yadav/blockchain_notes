Bitcoin:-
    Tech:-  blockchain is a technology but bitcoin is a protocol which uses bitcoin tech.
    Coin:-  when a protocol is developed a coin is associateed with it so all the transaction happen it is happened via this coin.
    Tokens:- they used mainly for investments,token uses platform like bitcoin ,etherium etc,it is ICO(initial coin offering)
             they are list out in coinmarketcap.com 
Bitcoin monetory policies:- get more info at:- blockchain.com
    it is basically maintain the supply of money,
    satoshi gave 2 principle for bitcoin monetory policies;-
    1. the halving:-
        it is like in every four year or when block number reached  210000 then the bitcooin supply get halved and satoshi put limit on supply of bitcoin which is 21 million
    2. block frequency:-
        on an average it will take 10 min to create a new block
Blockchain Mining:-
    Transaction-->solve math problem-->miner who solve first-->other miner verification-->block added
    Noncs->"nonce is the number that blockchain miners are solving for"
        the whole mathimatical problem is to generate that hash
        block no,data,prev hast is immutable so it overall depend on nonce to generate hash of new block 
        so different value of noncs generate different hast we just have to get the bulls eye
        ex-> demoblockchain.org/block
         _____________________________    
        |   block no                  |  
        |   xxx /noncs                |
        |   data                      |
        |                             |
        |   prev hash                 |
        |       hash                  |

Target:-
    1.target is number used in Mining
    2. it is a number that a block hash must be below for the block to be added on the blockchain
    3. the target adjust every 2016 blocks(roughly 2 weeks) to try and ensure that block are mined 
       once every 10 min on average

Rate of generating hashes:-
    million hashes(mh)
        cpu<10 mh/sec
        gpu<1 gh/sec
        asic>1000 gh/sec

Minning pool:-
    a bunch of computer solve an problem and earn a block and the profit is distributed accoding the number of hashing that particular system generate
    ex. blockchain.com ->products->charts->hashrate distribution

nonce range:-
    nonce is a 32 bit number 2^32, range 0 to  4 billion 4*10^9
    sha 256 16^64 range 0 to 10^ 77 (total no of possible hashes generated)
    so,
      10^77>>>>>>10^9
      there are not enough nonce to generate the valid hash
    a modest nonce generate 10^8 hash/sec
    4*10^9 nonce will be covered in (4*10^9)/(10^8)=40 sec all nounce exausts so the miner never hit the target?

        |       hash                  |
        |_____________________________|

        timestamp contain unix time(it is time when unix start to till date)
        so with each sec when timestsmp change due to avalanch effect new hases created so miner never exaust its nonce and after a sec it will again start with 0 nonce
        currunt hashing rate 360 million trillion hashes/sec
Mempool:-
        it is an are where all unconfirm transaction takes place
        it contain transaction id and fee this fee given to miner for the verificationof that transaction

        1.mempool is not a centralised area
        2.every mempool is associateed with each node and each minner which is in that network

Transaction and Utxos:-
        utxos->unspend transaction output

        arjun ->me 0.4btc -------
        vishal ->me 0.2btc      |_____ utxos
        vikas ->me 0.7btc       |
        sid ->me 0.1btc---------- 
   
    now let suppose i want to buy coffe whose price is 0. 5btc
    transaction:-
             input [vikas -> 0.7btc] -------> output[0.5 btc to coffe] && [0.2 btc back to me from me]
  (only that utxos is greater than 0.5)          (here 0.2 is like change)
 
        arjun ->me 0.4btc -------
        vishal ->me 0.2btc      |_____ utxos
        me ->me 0.2btc          |
        sid ->me 0.1btc---------- 

Transaction fee:-
        it is the amount of fee you must pa like if coffe cost 0.5 btc then you have to pay 0.6 and that 0.1 goes to miner

Cryptocurrency wallet:-
        wallet only checks the transaction which i get and  it add up or we say it only count utxos of all blocks

private key and public key:-

    private key se public generate ki
    private + message se signature create hoga
    public + Private +signature se verification funct create kiya
        
        private key-------------------->public key
            |                           |
            |                           |
            |                           |    
            0<------ message ---------->0 verification funct
            |                           |        
            |                           |
            |_______>signature----------
        ex->tool.superdatascience.com

segregated witness:-
    block size of block chain generally 1 mb
    1.but in block max size is occupied by signature and public key -->60-65% scriptsig
    2.after 2017 when too much transaction and miner blockchain commitee decide to sepratly send dignature and public key that's why is called segregated witness
    3.it is all do to increase the number of transaction

public key vs bitcoin address:-
    1. bitcoin address derive from public key
    2. public key transaction karney ke kaam aati hai 
    3. bitcoin address transaction lene ke kaam aati hai 
    4. bitcoin addres is like an extra layer of protection

hierarchically deterministic (HD)wallet:-
    its for privacy of owner

    master private key------->private key 1------->public key 1---->address 1 
                     |
                     |
