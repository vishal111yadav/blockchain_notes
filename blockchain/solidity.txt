Remix Ide->deploy development administer

Remix important point:-
 language supporeted:-Solidity and viper
 Written in:-javascript
 Modules:-Testing,Debugging,Deploy

Smart contract compilation:-

                                                |-------->Abi
    contract ----------->Solidity Compiler------|
    source.sol file                             |_________>Byte code------>Etherium blockchain

    ABI->(abstract binary interface)if any other smart contract or any application want to communicate with 
         our smart contract it need this abi file.
         it at like bride between our smart contract and application

    Byte Code-> it only deploy on blockchain(it is the actual thing which run on each node on eth blockchain)

    1.contract Byte code is public in readable from
    2.contract doesn't have to be public
    3.bytecode is immutable
    4.abi act as a bride between application and smart contract
    5.abi and bytecode cannot be generated without source code

        MainNet                                         TestNet
    used for actual transaction                     used for Testing
    network id is 1                                 network id is 3,4,42

    ex:- masterthecrypto.com    

modifier:-
    is a type of function which can only be called by one which we want
    ex:-
     modifier onlyManager(){
        require(msg.sender==manager,"only manager can call this function");
        _;
    } 
     function createRequests(string memory _description,address payable _recipient, unit _value)public onlyManager{
        
    }

note:- if we ever use structure and use mapping in it then we are not able to use memory keyword on that function  we always use storage in that function
