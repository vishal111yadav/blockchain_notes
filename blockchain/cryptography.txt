cryptography:- 
    sender-->encryption-->decryption-->receiver
Two type's of cryptography:-
    symmetric:-
        sender generate a key and the encryption happen using that key which sender generate and that using same key receiver decrypt the message 
        if receiverdoesn't have same key he is unable to decrypt
        sender---->(message/key)--->receiver
        so a hacker can compromise the message because a sender have to send message with a key
    Asymmetric:-
       A public key                                       B  public key
       A private key                                      B  private key     
            A --------------------------------------------->B

    A's public key we can encrypt the message and with the use of A's private key we can decrypt the message

           B public key                                       A  public key
           A private key                                      B  private key     
                   A --------------------------------------------->B

    as we know a can have b public key for use as b public key is public

    now for encryption a use b public key so when data send to b so with the use of b private key b can decrypt the data


cryptography in blockchain:-
        private key+message =>signature

        for verification the miner use signature +message+public key to verify that transaction is is from right person or not
