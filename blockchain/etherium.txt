Etherium->
    created by vitalik buterin at age 19
    it start run program on block means(smart contract) we can create decentralization app
    bitcoin hume token nahi but etherium deta hai jiski help se hum program run kar sakte hai

Etherium Nodes->
    all system are in etherium network are nodes/clients
    Types of nodes:-
    1.full node:-
                generally miners are because full node responsibility is verification validity of entire network transaction
                (locally store a copy of entire blockchain)
    2.light node:-
                just use network for transaction
                (stores only the block header, fully depand on full node)
    3.archive node:-
                stores everything kept in full node and built an archiveof historic data
                requires terabyte of diskspaces

Etherium Accounts:-
    It is an entitywith an ether(ETH) balance that can send or recieve transaction on etherium
    Types of Etherium Accounts
    1.externally owned account(EOA):-
        it created when we add wallet,
        it is used for send/recieve transaction or to interacr smart contract
    2.contract account(CA):-
        it is controlled by contract code
        it only created when we deploy our smart contract
        it that block in which we put our smart contract and it have an address like other block

                EOA                                                     CA
            private key needed           |  no public and private key needed
            controlled by human          |  controlled bu contract code
            no gas associateed           |  gas associated
            have unique address          |  have unique address 
                hold eth balance         |  hold eth balance 

Smart Contract:-
    it is  program that run on our eth blockchain
    it used scripting language "solidity" (it is turing complete:- means we can create logic here) 
    we can implement loops in eth

Decentralized Application(Dapps):-
    smart contract(Backend) + front end
    ex:-search engine ->presearch
        twitter-->lbry
        youtube-->d.tube

Etherium virtual machine(EVVM):-
    dapp is not run on system is run on evm 

Etherium Gas:-
    if we want to run eth smart contract on blockchian it need some particular operation that need gas
    every operation have particular gas 
    the user that generate transaction has to pay gas
    ex 
    + need 3 gas
    - need 3 gas
    * need 5 gas
    \ need 5 gas
    = need 3 gas
    to view all operation gas value visit Ethereum Gas Chart - https://github.com/djrtwo/evm-opcode-gas-costs

Gas Price:-
    it is the amount the sender wants to pay per unit of gas to get the transaction mined, gas price is set by the sender
    gas price are denoted in gwei(1gwei=10^-9 eth)
    the higher the gas price the faster the transaction will be mined,it just like bitcoin transaction

Ethereum gas limit:-
    gas limit is the max gas the transaction can consume
    set by sender
    ex:
    let say A want to send B 2 Eth:-
    A set the gas price per unit =100gwei
    transaction gas limit =2100 unit
    total fee=gas unit(limit)* gas price per unit
    total fee=2100*100=210000gwei or 0.0021 ETH

Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAOS):-
                               smart contract
                                     |
                                     |

                        smart contract         smart contract
        |----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        |        DAOS                              |          traditional Organization
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        |    fully democratized                    |           usually hierarchical
        |    voting require                        |          voting may or may not require
        |no trusted intermediary                   |          intermediary require to count vote or out come handle manually
        |service handle automatically              |          require human handling or centralised control automatation
        |all activity transparent and fully public |        all activity mainly private and limited to public

The Dao Attack:-
                    The Dao is an Organization
                            
                    the dao    <-------------------------people
                    |               give eth                |
                    |           ------------------------->  |
                    |                  dao token            |
                    |                                       |    
                  investments proposal <--------------------
                                            vote

Hard Fork:-
        due to some problem in the dao smart contract hacker were able to extract money 
        to stop this commitee decide to upgrade smart contract it divided it into 2 chain(Ethereum classic ,Ethereum new version)
        1.during a hard fork s/w implementation a protocol and its mining process is upgrade
        2.once a user upgrade their s/w that version reject all transaction from old s/w effectively create anew branchof blockchain
        3.however those users who retain the old s/w continue to process Transaction

soft fork:-
        soft forks are a change to protocol but the end product same
        a soft forks is a backward-compatible upgrade meaning that the upgrade node still communicate with non upgrade nodes and who have longest chain win 

Initial coin offering(ICO's):-
        it the token which people buy it is like an bouchers which made coin cheap

Ethereum 2.0(serenity):-
        it follow scalability
        it have more security
        it is more sustainable
    it have major upgrades:
        1 proof of stake(POS):-
            pos dont have miners it have validators 
            to become validator the person need to give some ethers(32 eth) to system
            now the work of validator is to attach blocks(attachtation)
            if validator work honestly her ether return + transaction fee(attachtation)
            if validator doesn't work honestly he dong get ether return and no transaction fee return
            here system select the validator via randomness
            and here randomness is selected by the number of ether you put on stack

        |----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        |        proof of work                     |         proof of stack
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        |    miners                                |           validator
        |  high performance h/w req                |            mobile laptop enough
        |lots of electricity req                   |          not much electricity req
        |the morehashing power you                 |         the more eth you put on stack the more block you validate
        |        have more block you validate      |
        | attack to happen 51% hasing power is req |      attack to happen 51% of stack is req
        |competition is high here                  |      random selection here
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        2 sharding:-
                it is a process to split long blockchain into small db and then we distribute a these small db into differnt network
                so particular set of miner can only acces a small db
            major advantages:-
            1.transaction per sec increases
            2.powerful and expensive computer will not be needed
            3.more validator join
            4.energy consuption reduce

            beacon + etherium = beacon+etherium +  shard  = Ethereum +beacon shard chain
            chain     mainNet                       chain

Alt coin:-
        despite bitcoin all other coin are alt coin(coins other than bitcoin)
        ex investopedia.com
